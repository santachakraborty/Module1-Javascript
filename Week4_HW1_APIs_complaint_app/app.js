//Users should be able to see five buttons for the five boroughs of New York City when they load the page
//Users should also be able to see an input box where they can put in a number of how many complaints they want to see
//When the user clicks on one of the five buttons, a list of complaints should be displayed on the page, according to the number they input AND the borough they clicked on
//If the user doesn't input any number, make the default be 10
//they only want complaints that were handled by the NYPD! (hint: consider filtering for a specific "agency" when making the API call)
//When the list of complaints is shown, each complaint should also have a button on it that reads something along the lines of "toggle police response"
//When the user clicks on on the "toggle police response" button, it should then toggle how the police responded to that particular complaint
//Make sure it only toggles the response for that one complaint, not the entire list!
